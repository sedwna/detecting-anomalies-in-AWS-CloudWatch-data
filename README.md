# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This repository contains three different approaches for detecting anomalies in time series data:
1. **Density Estimation**: Uses multivariate Gaussian distribution to estimate the likelihood of data points.
2. **Isolation Forest**: An unsupervised algorithm that isolates anomalies using random forests.
3. **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: A density-based method that identifies outliers by comparing the local density of a point to its neighbors.

The dataset used is the `elb_request_count_8c0756.csv` from the **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)**, which contains time-stamped request counts from an AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

## Dataset üìä

The dataset used in this project is from the **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)**. Specifically, it uses the `realAWSCloudwatch/elb_request_count_8c0756.csv` file, which contains time-stamped request counts from an AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

You can download the dataset from the [NAB GitHub repository](https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data/realAWSCloudwatch).

## Methods Overview üß†

### 1. Density Estimation

- **Description**: Uses a multivariate Gaussian distribution to estimate the likelihood of data points. Points with low likelihood are flagged as anomalies.
- **Steps**:
  1. Preprocess the data and create lagged features.
  2. Fit a multivariate Gaussian distribution to the data.
  3. Calculate the log-likelihood of each data point.
  4. Flag points with log-likelihood below a threshold as anomalies.

### 2. Isolation Forest

- **Description**: An unsupervised algorithm that isolates anomalies by randomly selecting features and splitting data points.
- **Steps**:
  1. Preprocess the data and create lagged features.
  2. Train an Isolation Forest model.
  3. Predict anomalies using the trained model.
  4. Visualize the results.

### 3. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

- **Description**: A density-based method that compares the local density of a point to its neighbors. Points with significantly lower density are flagged as anomalies.
- **Steps**:
  1. Preprocess the data and create lagged features.
  2. Train an LOF model.
  3. Predict anomalies using the trained model.
  4. Visualize the results.

## Visualization üìà

Each method generates the following visualizations:

1. **Time Series Plot**:
   - A line plot of the time series data.
   - Anomalies are highlighted with red dots.

2. **Anomaly Distribution**:
   - A histogram or scatter plot showing the distribution of normal vs. anomalous data points.

### Example Plots
